abstract: Illicit economies, such as coca crops, provide an unparalleled source of wealth for in- surgencies, paramilitaries, and criminal organizations. While state interventions, such as forced aerial spraying eradication, seek to weaken illicit economies and ultimately build political order, peace, and stability, outcomes on the ground typically diverge from these intentions. How do attempts at curtailing illicit markets at the origin of the production and trafficking chain shape dynamics of armed conflict violence? By focusing on the case of Colombia, we study the effects of these type of interventions on armed conflict violence. We analyze municipal data of coca crops eradication by aerial spraying between 2000 and 2015, and find that it increased violent events associated to non-state armed actors. Our work suggests that state coercive eradication policies, such as aerial spraying, rather than consolidate security, can lead to greater incentives and opportunities for the use of violence via three mechanisms*:* armed group backlash against the state, turf wars between armed groups, and the erosion of social contracts with the population.
