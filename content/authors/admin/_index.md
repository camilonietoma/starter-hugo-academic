In many Latin American countries, state institutions operate in regions where violent groups--from insurgencies and self-defense forces to street gangs and drug cartels--compete for authority. What are the causes and consequences of the uneven and contested presence of state institutions during conflict and its aftermath?
 
My research explores political violence, state building, criminal governance, and transitional justice, with a regional focus on Latin America. In particular, I investigate why some societies experience major outbreaks of violence, how state institutions and criminal groups operate during periods of conflict, and the mechanisms through which societies address human rights violations and rebuild governance after war.

I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Political Science at the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu), where I also serve as Assistant Director for The UTSA [Center for Public Opinion Research](https://colfa.utsa.edu/political-opinion/). I am also a Research Affiliate at the [Violence and Transitional Justice Lab](https://kellogg.nd.edu/v-tj-lab-about) at Notre Dame's Kellogg Institute. Prior to coming to UTSA, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Center for Inter-American Policy and Research (CIPR)](https://cipr.tulane.edu) at Tulane University.
