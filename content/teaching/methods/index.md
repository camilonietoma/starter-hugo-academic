summary: Spring 2024
abstract: This course aims to equip students with a basic understanding of the empirical and quantitative methods used by social scientists to study social and political phenomena. In each session, we will strike a balance between theory and practice. In particular, we will learn how to use R, a powerful programming language with multiple uses in data analysis. We will begin by learning how to import datasets into R and focusing on the fundamentals of data visualization and data wrangling. After that, we will delve into the main building blocks of data modeling and statistical analysis, namely, linear regression with one and multiple independent variables. This portion of the course will also introduce the fundamental problem of causal inference and some of its solutions, with a focus on natural experiments. Finally, the course will introduce students to statistical inference, sampling, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
